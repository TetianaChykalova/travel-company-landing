## Implementation

Tech stack: HTML5 / CSS3 / JS / Swiper.js.
The website have adaptive versions for different devices.

An additional library was used to create the slider:
https://swiperjs.com/

The result has base optimisation (in the swiper.js file)

## Difficalty

The most difficult part of this project was working with the swiper. 

Also, the work was long due to the png file, usually, I have a design in Figma or Photoshop.

## Problems

The swiper in the "editors pick" section doesn't work correctly in the desktop version. Changing from one slider to another happens instantly instead of gradually. Unfortunately, I could not find out the reasons for this behavior. But this will be my task for the future
